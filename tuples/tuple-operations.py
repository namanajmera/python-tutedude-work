# Tuple

t1 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
t2 = (11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,20)
print(t1)
print(t2)

print(t1 + t2)
print(t1[-1])
# Give the error because tuple are immutables
# t1[-1] = 20
# print(t1)

# Almost same operations we can perform in Tuples also
# Like sum(), max(), concat() etc..
